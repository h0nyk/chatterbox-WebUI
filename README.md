## üÜï What's New in This Fork

### **üéØ One-Click Windows Installation**
- **Automatic environment setup** with CUDA 11.8 support
- **No technical knowledge required** - just run [`one-click-installer.bat`](https://github.com/Saganaki22/chatterbox-WebUI/releases/tag/oneclick) or `install.bat`
- **Instant launcher** - double-click `run_tts.bat` to start

### **üöÄ Smart Long-Form Processing** *(New Feature!)*
What the original didn't have:
- **Smart Text Chunking**: Automatically splits long documents at sentence boundaries
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes multiple chunks simultaneously for 4x faster generation
- **Seamless Audio Stitching**: Combines chunks into one cohesive audio file
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators during generation
- **Voice Consistency**: Maintains the same cloned voice across all chunks
- **Configurable Batch Size**: Adjust parallel processing for your hardware

**Perfect for**: Articles, books, scripts, documentation, or any text longer than 300 characters!

## üöÄ Quick Start (Windows)

### Method 1 - One click installation (Recommended)
Download [`one-click-installer.bat`](https://github.com/Saganaki22/chatterbox-WebUI/releases/tag/oneclick)
and just run

### Method 2 (try this method if one-click installation fails)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saganaki22/chatterbox-WebUI
cd chatterbox-WebUI
install.bat
```

### Launch WebUI
```bash
run_tts.bat
```

Then open: **http://127.0.0.1:7860/**

That's it! üéâ

I've provided 11 high quality ENG voice samples to get you started, find them in /samples/*

## üìñ About Chatterbox TTS

_Made with ‚ô•Ô∏è by <a href="https://resemble.ai" target="_blank"><img width="100" alt="resemble-logo-horizontal" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35cf756b-3506-4943-9c72-c05ddfa4e525" /></a>

We're excited to introduce Chatterbox, [Resemble AI's](https://resemble.ai) first production-grade open source TTS model. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control**, a powerful feature that makes your voices stand out.

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (<a href="https://resemble.ai">link</a>). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms‚Äîideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

## üî• Key Features
- **SoTA zeroshot TTS** - State-of-the-art voice cloning
- **0.5B Llama backbone** - Powerful language model foundation
- **Unique exaggeration/intensity control** - First open-source TTS with emotion control
- **Ultra-stable with alignment-informed inference** - Consistent, high-quality output
- **Trained on 0.5M hours** of cleaned data
- **Watermarked outputs** - Built-in Perth watermarking for responsible AI
- **Easy voice conversion** - Simple reference audio upload
- **[Outperforms ElevenLabs](https://podonos.com/resembleai/chatterbox)** in side-by-side comparisons

## üí° Usage Tips

### **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
- The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts.
- If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

### **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
- Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
- Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.

### **Long-Form Content:**
- Use the **Long Form Content** tab for documents, articles, or scripts
- Adjust **Batch Size** (1-8) based on your GPU memory
- Set **Chunk Size** (100-500 chars) for optimal sentence splitting
- Upload reference audio once - it applies to all chunks automatically

## üîß Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer manual installation or need to customize:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install PyTorch with CUDA 11.8
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 torchaudio==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install ChatterboxTTS and Gradio
pip install chatterbox-tts gradio

# Run the WebUI
python gradio_tts_app.py
```

## üêç Python API Usage
```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS

model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-1.wav", wav, model.sr)

# Voice cloning with reference audio
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH="YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è WebUI Features

## üèóÔ∏è Original Repository

This fork is based on the original [Resemble AI Chatterbox TTS](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox). All core TTS functionality and model weights remain unchanged - we've simply added Windows-friendly installation and an enhanced web interface with long-form processing capabilities.

## üîí Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.
